# learningRxJava
I am Learning RxJava, so basically I am reading a book called "Learning RxJava by Packt", so making notes with practicals with it.

You can easily learn RxJava by looking at the comments and running the code. Also if you know RxJava, you can refresh it anytime with this repository.
